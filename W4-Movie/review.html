                <p class="content-p"><b>Robert Blye</b> <i>April 17, 2025</i><br><br> The Movie takes place in Somalia in 1993. The movie is based on true events of Operation Gothic Serpent. The actor actually trained with the units they were portraying to make it as accurate as possible and to give them a understanding of what the guys had to endure. The mission was to capture two lieutenants of a warlord while four ranger chalks established an outer cordon. The mission was supposed to be a quick capture and exfil. That all changed when one of the Blackhawk helicopters (Super 61) providing overwatch for the extraction team got hit with a rpg and crashed in the city.<br><br> The city had erupted into chaos and became a war zone in a matter of minutes. The Rangers then had to move to secure the first crash site while encountering a heavy resistance. When Super 61 went down Super 64 took Super 61's position. Super 64 was then hit by a rpg while in the holding pattern and crashed in the city. The Rangers were hitting roadblock after roadblock while trying to get to the crash sites. The Convoy encountered heavy resistance on the way to the crash site and had to eventually go back to base to rearm and get more personally because they were combat ineffective<br><br> There was a overwatch team from delta who requested permission to go in on foot and secure the Super 64 crash site. MSG.Gary Gordon and SFC.Randy Shughart had rescued CWO.Mike Durant but were tragically killed in the process. CWO.Mike Durant was taken captive once he was the last one alive.<br><br> The Rangers had made it to the Super 61 crash site and secured it while delta operators had left the convoy on the way back after rearming, and pushed to secure the Super 64 crash site. The Rangers provided cover while the bodies from Super 61 were being extracted. After they bodies had been recovered, the Rangers had to run out of the city because there was no room in the vehicles and getting on top of them would have been a death wish. The Rangers walked approximately one mile from the Super 61 crash site to the Olympic Stadium, this trek is known as the "Mogadishu Mile".</p>
